## Description
The software will check the IP address of the given DNS records in Cloudflare and will match it against the current public IP address. The software will update the IP address of the DNS records in Cloudflare through the API when the IP addresses differ from the current public IP address.

## Installation
Pull the docker image and mount a volume from the host for persistent storage:
```
docker pull oezie/cfdyndns:latest
docker run -d --name cfdyndns -v /host-data/:/data/ --restart unless-stopped oezie/cfdyndns:latest
```
The software will add an appsettings.json file in the /data folder. Please update the settings in this file according to your needs.

## Configuration
